# DPHS921_IPTW

This repository contains files to create an R/Shiny application that I used to teaching about propensity score analyses in PHS921 at Duke University.  It contains two example data sets, however, only the NSAID data is currently suitble for use.

The Shiny application is hosted here: https://abrookhart.shinyapps.io/DPHS921-IPTW/
